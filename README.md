# AdyGPT

>app.py- Uses streamlit. Can't host publicly because the .bin file for the model used is too big.

>app1.py- Uses Gradio

**requirements.txt doesn't have gradio version.**


Anyone who wants to access the .bin files, i.e., the model weights, can download GPT4ALL on their systems and download the weights.
